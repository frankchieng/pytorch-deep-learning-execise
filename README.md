# pytorch-deep-learning-exercise
implementing the exercise work of https://github.com/mrdbourke/pytorch-deep-learning

i strongly recommend everyone who want to learn pytorch should learn about this author's tutorial and finish the exercise work,happy coding

tips:
i've modified the default tiny VGG model achitecture in 03_pytorch_computer_vision_exercise_solutions.ipynb, add BatchNorm2D and Dropout,just compare it with the orginal model,it turns out the new model generalized well on the test data,cuz solve the overfitting problem a little bit.
